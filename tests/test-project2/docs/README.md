# Docs

Welcome to the Acme Platform documentation hub.

This nested README exists inside the `docs/` folder and is intentionally
**not linked from the root README**. It represents a common pattern where
teams add a README inside a docs directory but forget to surface it from
the root. The MD Files Connector should flag this as isolated.

## Contents

- `api/` — REST and GraphQL API reference
- `guides/` — User guides and tutorials
- `internal/` — Internal architecture and decision records
- `adr/` — Architecture Decision Records
